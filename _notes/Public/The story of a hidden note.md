title: The story of a hidden note
notetype : unfeed

Tada! You found the hidden note! This note is just like [[Markdown Rendered]], but since the notetype is `unfeed` it's hidden from the feed. 
Please remember that the intention here is to declutter the feed and not provide any 'protection' to the content. Notes with `unfeed` notetype will be synced to Github, accessed via URL, and hyperlinked. 

### What to do with Private notes? 
Well. I would recommend sorting it in the Obsidian app. Inside the'_notes' folder, create sub-folders (Eg: Public and Private), and mark Private in .gitignored. The note won't even get synced to Github. Do check my [workflow]() if you want to know more.

PS: Can you see the backlink to Welcome to the garden? That's backlinking! :)
